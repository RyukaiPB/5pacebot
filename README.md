A simple bot for twitch.tv
--------------------------

While technically could be made to be a regular irc bot, I made this as my personal stream management bot for twitch.

This was an exercise in making a simple irc bot with a lot of potential functionality.

### Quick Startup Guide ###
1. Make sure you have the prerequisites, listed here:
    - git
    - Ruby 2.0 or higher
    - libyaml
    - a *nix like environment (you could possibly go without that, but I don't support windows directly, outside of cygwin and the like)
2. Clone this repository locally.
3. Edit `bot.yaml` according to the comments in there.
4. Edit `mods.yaml` to include your name.
5. Run `bot.rb` inside of `5pacebot/`

You should also consider examining the `plugins/` directory, to see what kind of commands are available by default, and the general syntax to adding new ones.

### Inner Workings ###

Here is a simple overview of how the bot works:

1. The bot parses bot.yaml to get the connection information.
2. The bot will load everything in `util/*.rb`. Those files contain utility functions that are to be available to plugins. They are to only include bot specific things, the closest it gets to plugin-land is the mod functions.
3. The bot will then load everything in `plugins/*.rb`. For each file loaded, it will call `gethooks()` which returns a hash. The key of the hash is a regex that determines when the command is to be triggered. The value of the hash contains a symbol to the function which is to be called when that command is triggered. The bot adds all of these entries to the hooks Hash.
4. Every time a message arrives, the bot iterates over all the hooks' keys, and if any of them match, calls the associated function.

Reloading both `util/*.rb` and `plugins/*.rb` is thus trivial. The functionality of the bot is rather simple, making it less prone for difficult errors and easier to modify for specific needs.

### How to Upgrade ###

1. Run `git stash` to save all your non-in-tree changes.
2. Run `git pull` to pull in the latest version from git.
3. Run `git stash apply` to bring back your personal changes.

This might go wrong if you've edited more than the .yaml files (which are meant to get modified by the user). In that case, check your changes (`git status` before stashing them), and see if the tree's changes conflict with yours.
